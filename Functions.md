### Functions

## Main function

Every entry point code/script must have an entry function.
An entry function is defined using the following:

`function main() = { }`

NOTE: the scripts  that do not have main function can be imported, but cannot be executed directly. The main function is automatically called on entry. However, if you need to, you can still call the main() functions explicitly.

## Functions

All functions are defined with the word `function`. Functions can contain alphanumeric values (including _) and functions cannot start with numeric value.
