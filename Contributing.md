# Welcome to Juliar.Future Project

I would like to thank you for contributing to the Juliar.Future Project.
The aim of this project is to build a fully functional compiler 
for *Juliar * Programming language that will compile for use in Java Environments.

Here are some helpful guidelines for contributing:

## The *Juliar * Communtiy
Have an idea or a big feature. Please make sure to post it in our forums
at [https://juliar.org/forums](https://juliar.org/forums) . Make sure that you have gotten a response
from one of the administrators before doing something big. For smaller updates,
feel free to fork the repo, add examples, and submit pull requests.

## Bugs
Bug fixes are always welcomed and are encouraged. If you do not know how to fix a bug,
please make sure to post it on forums at [https://juliar.org/forums](https://juliar.org/forums) as well as
posting it in the issues section of this github page.

## Styling
Please follow the coding outlined at
https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

## Compiling with an IntelliJ IDEA
We use IntelliJ IDEA in order to have a nice environment to build the project.
Follow the steps below to setup the IntelliJ environment for development of JuliarFuture.

## Documentation
Anybody is free to fix the documentation. The Documentation is one of
the harder part of the project. It's hard to write it and it's even 
harder to maintain. If you can help with that, it will be greatly appreciated
Make sure to post any big changes on the forums to get some feedback.

## Testing
Most of the testing will be automated. However, there is no substitute
for a human being. The testing is probably harder than coding.
Writing a test is always welcomed. Make sure to focus on edge cases
when you write a test.


## Coding & Submitting to Github
Keep the code clean by following K.I.S.S. principle. 
If you want to make a major change, just fork the project, update it,
and once you've fully implemented the fix, submit a pull request to
the main project.


## Thank You
Thank you for contributing. Your contribution is very important!
