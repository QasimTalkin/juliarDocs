# Loops

## While loop

In Juliar, while loop is defined similarly to most of the other
programming languages.

A simple example of while loop:

> int x = 0;
> while(x < 2) = {
> 	x = + 1 x;
> }

In this example x is set to 0. The `while` statement checks 
and sees that x must be less than 2 and returns true.
The while loop runs. The value of x is increase by 1.
This is a Juliar way of increasing values. The `while` loop
only runs twice.
